Part of me, of course, was happy because it was a nice thing to hear, but the other part wondered...would she've said a similar thing to my wife? To the best of my understanding, the answer would have surely been no, because sexism, no matter how low-key it may be, is still very much a part of our culture. That said, a key to lessening this sexism is awareness, and a lot of that awareness comes through feminism. And, it's hard to talk about that subject without mentioning a pioneer of the American feminist movement, the kick-ass woman of the S sprint, Gloria Steinem.</p><p>Gloria got her career start as a journalist, already a feminist at heart <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Her first "serious assignment" was about contraception, where she illustrated a world in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage. This career eventually lead her to an assignment where she took up employment as a Playboy Bunny, and later published "A Bunny's Tale," a look at the exploitive working conditions of others who shared this title <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Her career in journalism was chocked full of stories like this, far too many to list. But, it was <a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/46802/">"After Black Power, Women's Liberation"</a> that brought her to national fame as a a feminist leader.</p><p>This lead her to campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment (she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in its favor in 1970), lead her to co-found the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), lead her down a path of making this world a bit more fair for women (the amount of things she's done is both inspiring and overwhelming to summarize).</p><p>That said, a world that is more fair for women doesn't mean one that is unjust to men. Increasing equality is always a net win, always lifts everyone up. This, I would expect, would be an obvious statement, but when I see a quote like "If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried," <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> I realize we still have a lot of progress to be made.</p><p>Anyway, Gloria helped start us down this path and is continuing to change the minds of those willing to listen. I know she's been a strong influence in my life, and I'm hoping that translates to a better tomorrow for all of us.</p><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><a id="1"></a> I would assume <em>most</em> women are naturally feminists.
